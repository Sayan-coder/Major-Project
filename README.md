According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S. They affect 40 million adults, or 18.1% of the population, every year. Furthermore, anxiety disorders affect 25.1% of children between 13 and 18 years old, putting them at a much higher risk to perform poorly in school, engage in substance abuse, and miss out on important social experiences. Even though this disorder is highly treatable, only 36.9% of those suffering receive treatment, most likely due to a perceived societal stigma, with men far less likely to seek treatment. 

We created a Machine Learning Model which can predict whether a person is suffering from mental health disorders or not. Our project focuses whether a person is affected by any kind of depression and further explores the fact if in case of Major Depressive Disorder, whether the person is probable towards Suicide or not. It was a Classification based Machine Learning approach where several algorithms were employed. However Logistic Regression gave us the highest accuracy of about 91% when implemented inside a Confusion Matrix. We also created an Interface for the users with the help of Tkinter in Python for the users to input the values and get instant results.
